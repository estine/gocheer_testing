### Raspberry Pi PiTFT Examples

To demonstrate working with remotely connected hardware, there are a couple examples that make use of a Raspberry Pi and a [PiTFT touchscreen module][4].


#### Installation on a Raspberry Pi

```
$ git clone https://github.com/toddtreece/osc-examples.git
$ cd osc-examples/pitft
$ npm install
