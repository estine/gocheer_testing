To connect to the Amazon EC2 Instance:

What you’ll need:
1. The private certificate for accessing the instance (download here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ftsni9c7lxj0mh7/ec2-amazon-linux.pem?dl=1)
2. A terminal (and internet connection)

First, download the certificate, and make sure it’s not publicly viewable by cd-ing into the directory where you downloaded it and running the following command:

sudo chmod 400 ec2-amazon-linux.pem

Second, run the following command:

sudo ssh -i "ec2-amazon-linux.pem" ec2-user@ec2-18-222-176-253.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

If all is well, you should ssh into the instance. It has node installed, and the gocheer_testing git repository cloned in /. If you run “ps auxf | grep node”, you should be able to see the node server running (it’s in the background so a normal “ps” command won’t find it).

---

If the Node server is running, to kill it, run the following to find its process ID (PID):

ps -auxf | grep node

This will spit out a ~bunch~ of stuff. You're just looking for the process "node .". Finding this process, determine its PID (will be something like 12345).

Then run the following (using that PID, assuming its 12345):

kill -9 12345

This kills the Node server, so a new Node server can be started!

The code is currently in root, within the cloned github repo...
